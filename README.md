# svenBot

svenBot is a **simple/lightweight** music bot for Discord, made with **Python 3.6**.
It is currently under heavy development, many features still to be added, 
but it will still remain a fairly simple and lightweight music bot.

## Acknowledged issues and bugs that I'm currently working on
- [x] Volume control and adding a volume value limitation
- [ ] Being able to queue properly with !play (replacing !queue)
- [ ] Bot to leave voice channel if nothing is playing
- [ ] Extract video information when using search string and not URL
